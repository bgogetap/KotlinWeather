# KotlinWeather

##Purpose
I created this project to get familiar with Kotlin.

KotlinWeather demonstrates how to use Dagger 2, Retrofit 2, and RxJava in Kotlin.

##Future
My original goal was to create another module that is an exact replica, but written in Java. This is still my plan and will be coming in the future weeks.

##Where are the tests??
While I had planned on adding tests, this wasn't the focus of the project and I have come to realize that my pattern (mainly, how I use Presenters) is not very friendly for testing. I may make more of an effort to add tests after completing the Java module.
